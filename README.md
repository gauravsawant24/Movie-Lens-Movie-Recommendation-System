# Movie-Lens-Movie-Recommendation-System
Here using pyspark we tried commonly used recommendation system techniques like Similarity algorithms and collaborative filtering algorithms to study their performance on a distributed system and how they scale.

•	Performed memory-based collaborative filtering techniques like Cosine similarities, Pearson’s r & model-based Matrix Factorization techniques like Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method 
•	Studied the scalability of these methods on local machines & on Hadoop clusters
